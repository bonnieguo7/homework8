Bonnie Guo -- Assignment 8

The purpose of this website is to give brief insight into who I am, whether it be to potential
employers, fellow students, or instructors. Within my website, I included a quick bio, two of my 
past projects and my resume. Upon opening the website, the users will view a typing animation
that will hopefully entice them to scroll through the rest of my website. 

I used Bootstrap to help create my navigation bars and cards. I chose to use Bootstrap to help 
with my spacing so that I wouldn't have to construct the CSS from the ground up. 

When implementing this website, I struggled greatly at first with understanding the Bootstrap 
framework. After understanding it better, I was able to develop the website pretty quickly. The next 
point of struggle came with creating the typing animation.
